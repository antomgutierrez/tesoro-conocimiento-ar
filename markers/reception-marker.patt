# Pattern file for Reception Marker
# This is a placeholder - in a real implementation, you would use a pattern generator
# For now, we'll create a simple pattern that can be used with AR.js

# Reception Marker Pattern
# This should be replaced with an actual .patt file generated by AR.js pattern generator
# The pattern should be unique and easily recognizable

# For development purposes, you can use the AR.js pattern generator:

# Placeholder pattern data (this needs to be replaced with actual pattern)
# The actual .patt file should contain binary pattern data
